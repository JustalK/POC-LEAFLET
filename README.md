# POC-LEAFLET

_Google map was my favorite tool for adding a map to a website. However, google map over the years became quite expensive._. OpenStreetMap is an alternative open-source of google map. For using it, a package named `leaflet` has been created.

In this proof-of-concept, I am using `React` and `leaflet` for showing the possibility of the package.

## Plan of the presentation

I explain with all the details how I build the project and my way of working.
